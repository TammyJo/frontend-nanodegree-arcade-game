-------------------------------
LOAD GAME:

Double-click on the 'index.html' file to open the game in your browser.

HOW TO PLAY:

Use the arrow keys ( UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT) to move around the board, trying to get your player to the water.
You must NOT let your character get hit by a bug, or you will lose and have to start over.
If you reach the top, you win! After winning, press the UP arrow to start a new game.

Special game function:

Press 'r' to toggle between your character and a rock.
When you are a rock, you are safe from the bugs, as they will walk behind you, but you also cannot move!
You must turn back into your character to move again.

Have fun!
